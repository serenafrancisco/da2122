Theoretical question 1:
What is FastQC program? (write at least three phases to describe strengs and limits of FastQC)

Theoretical question 2:
What is dispersion in differential expression analysis.


Practical question 1:
There is an overlap among de and cpm, but the final file is empty.  Find the errors.

de <- read.table("DEfiltered_mirna_log2fc_1_fdr_0.05.txt", sep="\t", header=T, row.names=1)
cpm <- read.table("w_covar_cpm.txt"", sep="\t", header=T, row.names=1)
log2cpm <- log2(cpm + 1)
log2cpm <- log2cpm[grep("mirBase$", rownames(log2cpm)),]
rownames(log2cpm) <- sub("mirBase$","", rownames(log2cpm))
log2cpm.f <- log2cpm[which(rownames(log2cpm) %in% rownames(de)),]
write.table(log2cpm.f, "de_log2CPM.txt", sep="\t", col.names=NA)


Practical question 2:
Using the pca function from docker4seq create the plot for the file w_covar_cpm.txt (it is not log2 transformed).
For PCA you need to have the file in log2

Practical question 3:
In the folder of the example you have three folder ra, rb and rc, in each folder there is the file Log.final.out generated by STAR

Write a script that create a table containing as header ra, rb and rc names and as rownames "Uniquely mapped reads number"" 
and "Number of reads mapped to multiple loci"

Extract from the files the requested numbers and create the 3 col x 2 row matrix
saver the matrix a comma separated file
