Theoretical question 1:
Which are the roles used by cellranger to assign the a sequenced read to a transcript?

Theoretical question 2:
Which is the most important difference between PCA and UMAP?


Practical question 1:
mytable.csv opened with excel does not have the col.names correctly aligned. Modify write.table to have the col.names of the table correctly aligned.

tmp <- read.table("VandE_clustering.output.csv", sep=",", header=T, row.names=1, stringsAsFactors=T)
library(ggplot2)
plot.df <- data.frame(tmp$Belonging_Cluster, tmp$neighbor)
names(plot.df) <- c("clusters", "neighbor")
ggplot(plot.df, aes(x=clusters, y=neighbors)) + 
    geom_density_2d()
	
write.table(table(plot.df), "mytable.csv", sep=",")

Practical question 2:

plot.df <- data.frame(tmp$Belonging_Cluster, tmp$silhouetteValue)
names(plot.df) <- c("clusters", "silhouette")
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(plot.df, aes(x=clusters, y=silhouette)) + 
  geom_violin()
p

The plot should produce 5 violin plots (as shown in the picture question2.png. Change the script to obtain it.


Practical question 3:
Write a script to create a count table (saved as cls5.csv) from VandE.csv including only cluster 5 cells (tmp$Belonging_Cluster)
rownames of cls5.csv should be only the ensembl ID , eg. ENSG00000275113
